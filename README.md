# SECD_Scheme
SECD_Scheme was developed after the development of SECD_Scheme8, incorporating the lessons learned from that project.
SECD_Scheme8 ended up with a dual design using both the SECD vm and the eval interpreter, a problem that could not be resolved until the end.
However, SECD_Scheme8 did have a unique mark-and-sweep type garbage collector design, which can be considered an achievement.
During the development of SECD_Scheme8, efforts were made to process multi-shot continuations as much as possible with the SECD vm, but ultimately it didn't work out.
It ended up being processed with the eval interpreter.

Therefore, with a fresh start, SECD_Scheme was developed with the focus on processing everything, including multi-shot continuations, with the SECD vm.
This time, we also devised a way to use AI: the AI ​​with limbs handled the implementation work, while the intelligent AI handled the basic design.
The actual actions taken are as follows:

- I consulted with Cursor's AI about writing a C++ version of a Scheme compiler that processes everything on the VM.

- I provided micro_Scheme8.lisp, mlib7.scm, and test-case6.scm as reference implementations.

- As a result, a C++ version of the Scheme compiler started working, which could process everything on the VM (although garbage collection was done using a reference counter method).

- At this point, only a few primitives worked, but the fact that multi-shot continuations were completely handled by the SECD VM was a major advantage!

- Afterwards, I consulted with another AI (Claude 4.5 Sonnet) and had them switch the GC from a reference counter-based approach to using Boehm GC.

- I also consulted with him about infinite-precision integers, and he implemented infinite-precision integers using the Boost library.

- During this time, GitHub Copilot acted as a hands-on AI, handling the implementation, testing, and debugging of the C++ version.

So, as you can see, SECD_Scheme is not something I created, but rather a C++ version of Scheme compiler using the complete SECD VM method, developed through the collaboration of various AIs.
